# shoes_api

Shoe API is an online shoe catalogue, user can view different stock. If a your want to see specific shoes, I have built filtering functionality to make searching easy.

This app is built with vanila HTML and CSS, no frontend frameworks were used.

To see how the app look so far here is a link: [Shoe API WebApp](https://siya-shoe-api.herokuapp.com/)
